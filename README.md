# MLOPS-Docker-Greet
A simple Flask-based web application to demonstrate how Docker can be used to containerize and deploy Python applications. The app accepts a user's name and returns a personalized greeting.

This project serves as a lightweight, beginner-friendly example for integrating Docker into a development workflow â€” a foundational step in modern MLOps and deployment practices.
