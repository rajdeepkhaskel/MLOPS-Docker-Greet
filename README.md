# MLOPS-Docker-Greet
A simple Flask-based web application to demonstrate how Docker can be used to containerize and deploy Python applications. The app accepts a user's name and returns a personalized greeting.

This project serves as a lightweight, beginner-friendly example for integrating Docker into a development workflow â€” a foundational step in modern MLOps and deployment practices.

To build the Docker image, use \
```docker build -t mlops-docker-greet .``` \
The name ```mlops-docker-greet``` can be of your choice.\
To run the docker image, use \
```docker run -p 5500:5500 mlops-docker-greet```
